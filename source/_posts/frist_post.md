I've updated my blog/website once again.  This time I'm going for something pretty simple and to the point as I'm dong more Devops/coding work and not as many big projects.  I'm around the web in various places like [GitHub](https://github.com/chrisbergeron), all the major ones (facebook, et al.)  and a few discord channels.

## I'm testing markup

### Why are you still reading
