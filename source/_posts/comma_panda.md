Comma is shpping the [Panda](http://comma.ai) interface again.  I received mine last week.  It's a wifi enabled OBDII interface.  The Panda is more than just a reader though.  It decodes and enables writing to the Media canbus.  It's going to make for some fun projects.  Using [Cabana](https://community.comma.ai/cabana/?demo=1) I should be able to create a Database file of the Kia Optima's CANbus protocol.
